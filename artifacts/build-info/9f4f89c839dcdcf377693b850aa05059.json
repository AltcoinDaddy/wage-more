Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

it."},"id":2414,"implemented":true,"kind":"function","modifiers":[],"name":"recover","nameLocation":"3723:7:7","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":2390,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":2387,"mutability":"mutable","name":"hash","nameLocation":"3739:4:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2414,"src":"3731:12:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":2386,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3731:7:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":2389,"mutability":"mutable","name":"signature","nameLocation":"3758:9:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2414,"src":"3745:22:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"memory","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_memory_ptr","typeString":"bytes"},"typeName":{"id":2388,"name":"bytes","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3745:5:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"3730:38:7"},"returnParameters":{"id":2393,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":2392,"mutability":"mutable","name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2414,"src":"3792:7:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":2391,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3792:7:7","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"3791:9:7"},"scope":2658,"src":"3714:255:7","stateMutability":"pure","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"body":{"id":2463,"nodeType":"Block","src":"4348:342:7","statements":[{"id":2462,"nodeType":"UncheckedBlock","src":"4358:326:7","statements":[{"assignments":[2432],"declarations":[{"constant":false,"id":2432,"mutability":"mutable","name":"s","nameLocation":"4390:1:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2462,"src":"4382:9:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":2431,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4382:7:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"id":2439,"initialValue":{"commonType":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"id":2438,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftExpression":{"id":2433,"name":"vs","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2421,"src":"4394:2:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"nodeType":"BinaryOperation","operator":"&","rightExpression":{"arguments":[{"hexValue":"307837666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666","id":2436,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"4407:66:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819967_by_1","typeString":"int_const

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.
